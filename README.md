# face-detection
A demo software that tries to achieve real-time face detection with deep learning algorithms.
Basically, this is a project which is used to learn some deep learning(DL) algorithms and image processing algorithms, at the same time
, to improve the ability of programming. We welcome all programmers to modify these code and share ideas and knowledge.

# Introduction
The project is mainly accomplished with two languages, which are C++ and Python, working on the Windows system. The structureÂ of this project includes two parts: one is that use **opencv** to obtain images from a camera of PC, another is that use **CNN or other DL methods** to detect whether there are faces in the image and where the faces are. The specific steps will be added in detail later. As for now, we apply caffe to bulid the CNN. As for the training process, the CNN needs to use some images with labels noting the coordinates of faces in images.

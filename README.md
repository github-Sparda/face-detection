# face-detection
A demo tries to achieve real-time face detection with deep learning algorithms **YOLO**
Basically, this is a project which is used to learn some deep learning(DL) algorithms and image processing algorithms, at the same time
, to improve the ability of programming. We welcome all programmers to modify these code and share ideas and knowledge.

# Introduction
The project is mainly accomplished with Python. **TensorFlow and Keras is needed.**
Get face images from CelebA dataset at http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html for training and test.

The specific steps will be added in detail later...
